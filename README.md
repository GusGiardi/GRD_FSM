# GRD_FSM
GRD_FSM is a Finite State Machine asset for Unity. This asset implements a node editor where developers can organize all states and their transitions. State behaviours can be easily created by implementing a class that inherits of FSM_StateBehaviour.

## Installation Guide
To add GRD_FSM in your project, just import the unitypackage. This asset is compatible with Unity 2020.3.28f1 or higher.
The FSM_Manager component can be added to any GameObject and by it you can open the node editor and create your own Finite State Machine.
